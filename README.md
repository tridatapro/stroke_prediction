# stroke_prediction
In this project, we embark on a journey to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict stroke incidence accurately.
The dataset used for this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/strokeprediction-dataset, and it contains a comprehensive set of features, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements. Our goal is to explore this dataset, gain insights into the factors contributing to stroke incidence, and develop predictive models to aid in stroke risk assessment.

The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, where we address missing values, handle categorical variables, and perform necessary transformations. Next, we delve into exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables. We categorize cardiovascular conditions into three categories based on hypertension, heart disease, or a combination of both, enabling us to analyze the impact of various factors on stroke incidence within each category.

We uncover intriguing findings during our analysis. In the category with multiple cardiovascular conditions, we observe no significant relationship between the variables and stroke incidence. However, in categories with either hypertension or heart disease alone, we identify key variables such as age and average glucose level that display a significant association with stroke incidence. Moreover, in the absence of any cardiovascular condition, variables like age, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status exhibit significant relationships with stroke incidence.

To harness these insights and build predictive models, we employ various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, and support vector machines. Despite achieving high accuracy during model training and testing, we encounter challenges in precision, recall, and other evaluation metrics. As a result, we explore techniques such as over-sampling, undersampling, and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to balance the imbalanced data. However, even after retraining and retesting the models, we find the results unsatisfactory, suggesting the complexity of the relationship between the predictors and stroke incidence.

This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of stroke prediction through data analysis and machine learning. By understanding the limitations and challenges encountered along the way, we gain valuable insights into the intricate nature of stroke incidence prediction. Through continued research and exploration, we strive to improve upon existing models and contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable stroke risk assessment tools.
